The analysis in this report draws from 4 main sources: 

- NHS Digital's Mental Health and Young People Survey (MHCYP)
- NHS Digital's  Mental Health Services Monthly Statistics (MHSDS)
- Health Education England's (HEE) Children and Young Peopleâ€™s Mental Health Services Workforce Report
- NHS Digital's workforce statistics

We have provided three documents that summarise how we arrived to each of the findings in this report, to help with the review and quality assurance process.
